Could someone with access to Internet Explorer possibly figure out what's wrong with this page?

Someone with IE told me the footer(s) are not displaying properly - they are not staying at the bottom.

There are two footers - a small one that starts with "Coming up", which is stacked on top of a larger one with links, copyright, etc. in it.  

This page is with content that should be longer than the browser window:

This one  has content that does not fill the browser window.

It looks fine in Firefox on Linux:

Any ideas?

Thanks!

Could someone with access to Internet Explorer possibly figure out what's wrong with this page?
<p/>
Someone with IE told me the footer(s) are not displaying properly - they are not staying at the bottom.
<p/>
There are two footers - a small one that starts with "Coming up", which is stacked on top of a larger one with links, copyright, etc. in it.  
<p/>
This page is with content that should be longer than the browser window:
<p/>
<a href="https://eggzample.github.io/halp.html">https://eggzample.github.io/halp.html</a>
<p/>
This one  has content that does not fill the browser window.
<p/>
<a href="https://eggzample.github.io/halp-short.html">https://eggzample.github.io/halp-short.html</a>
<p/>
It looks fine in Firefox on Linux:
<p/>

<p/>
Any ideas?
<p/>
Thanks!
